# Single-Layer-PCB
This Single-layer PCB Designed and Fabricated is my project in my college foundation lab - IoT in the first semester.

First, we used EasyEDT Online software to design the  PCB and Download the Gerber file. Next, Using an online Gerber file viewer, we find the top and bottom layers of the PCB.
Using CopperCAM Software, Just in PCB for Mach3 milling Machine to drill holes and put the path correctly,
Drill bits used 0.7mm,1mm, and 1.2mm.
Gcode is generated from copperCAM and the engraving file is auto-leveled using auto-leveler software.
Then, the Copper plate is inserted in the Mach3 Milling machine, and The Gcode file is sent to that machine.
Start printing the PCB.
After that, we apply Green ink to that PCB and dry using a UV Light Machine.
Clean the holes and make them ready for soldering the components.

Components used:
1. Polarised Capacitor
2. Capacitors
3. Regulator
4. Diodes
5. Connectors
   
The components are soldered in green on the surface.
Finally, a Single Layer through-hole PCB is Fabricated.
This is my first Project ever made.
